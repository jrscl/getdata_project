# Codebook for getdata_project

### Preamble
Data is from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone. 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measurements were captured. The obtained dataset was partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

### Original files used:
	activity_labels.txt	-	activity codes (1 through 6) and their descriptions
	features.txt		-	names of the measures recorded as columns in the X-train and X_test files
	subject_train		-	id of the person associated with each observation in the training group
	subject_test		-	id of the person associated with each observation in the test group
	y_train			-	activity code associated with each observation in the training group
	y_test			-	activity code associated with each observation in the test group
	X_train			-	measure readings associated with each observation in the training group
	X_test			-	measure readings associated with each observation in the test group
