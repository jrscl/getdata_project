# getdata_project

This repo contains a script that analyses a number of files from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 containing data collected from the smartphone accelerometers of volunteers performing physical activities. The script produces a single tidy dataset to support further analysis.

This repo also contains CodeBook.md with details of the data and the steps involved in producing the tidy dataset.
